          Hi, I'm a Front-end developer based in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. I am a
          self-taught programmer with a strong passion for creating visually
          appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

            >I discovered my love for programming about a year ago, and it has
            been a passion of mine ever since. Growing up, I always had an
            interest in technology and often found myself fixing technical
            issues for my family.
