          Hi, I'm a Front-end developer based in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. I am a
          self-taught programmer with a strong passion for creating visually
          appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

            been a passion of mine ever since. Growing up, I always had an
            interest in technology and often found myself fixing technical
            issues for my family.

<!-- I first discovered my interest in frontend development while in college, and since then have dedicated my time to learning as much as possible about the subject. To improve my skills, I have completed various online courses and tutorials, as well as participated in hackathons and coding competitions.

As a hobbyist frontend developer, I have developed a number of projects and apps that demonstrate my capabilities and attention to detail. I have also contributed to open source projects and joined online communities to share my knowledge and learn from others.

I am now ready to turn my love for frontend development into a career and am excited to explore the many opportunities available in the field. Whether it's building visually appealing websites or helping others learn to code, I am eager to take on new challenges and make a positive impact through my work. -->
